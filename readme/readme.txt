Plugin for CudaText.
For modified file, it shows dialog with comparision:
- text from the disk file (of the current file),
- maybe modified text (of the current file) from editor memory.
Allows to see differences before you save your changes to disk.

If the "Diff" lexer is installed to CudaText, plugin's dialog
will use this lexer to highlight changes.
